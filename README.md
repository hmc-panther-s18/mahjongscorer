# mahjongscorer
While playing mahjong with my family as we normally do, I realized that our method for keeping score is never consistent -- we've tried many methods from fake poker chips to hand tallies. Both ways have their strengths, but neither of them are convenient and reliable at a fast game pace. This is because of the complexity that comes with scoring in mahjong (many rules come into play that affect points -- dealer status (+ rounds of dealing), the types and combinations of tiles in hand while winning, etc. (More on that here: http://mahjong.wikidot.com/basic-rules)  While fussing over the inconvenience of calculating by hand and being too lazy to take out the poker chips, I got the idea to create a program that can help us keep score efficiently, quickly, and with no hassle of setup and cleanup other than taking out a laptop.  

The program was written with Java in Eclipse and takes an object-oriented approach using Classes and lists.
